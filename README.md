# Bioinformatics

My undergraduate research experiences have mostly dealt with analysing the algorithm implemented in the software Mutual for Heuristic Pairwise Aligment and trying to reproduce it. This algorithm compares two samples of de-novo mRNA-Seq data, represented as De-Bruijn graphs, to detect a retrive similar transcripts shared amongst the samples from the graph itself, recovering significantly more shared transcripts. All of these research experience have been under the amazing mentorship of [Dr. Humberto Ortiz Zuazaga](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/).

# Biomedical informatics  

I also worked with Causal Inference with graphical methods at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Causal Discovery as part of the iBRICK summer research internship program, under the mentorship of [Bryan Andrews](http://www.pitt.edu/~bja43/) and [Dr. Greg Cooper](http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/listings/gregory-cooper/). The research focused on exploring the use of both experimental and non-experimental(observational) datasets in the Causal Inference research pipeline algorithms in order to acquire more information from the data and enrich the inference results.
