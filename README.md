My undergraduate research experience dealt with analysing the algorithm implemented in the software Mutual for Heuristic Pairwise Aligment. This algorithm compare two samples of de-novo mRNA-Seq data, represented as De-Bruijn graphs, to detect a retrive similar transcripts shared amongst the samples. The publication for this algorithm is found [here](http://www.rna-seqblog.com/mutual-heuristic-pairwise-alignment-of-de-bruijn-graphs-to-facilitate-simultaneous-transcript-discovery/).  

The weekly research I performed at megaprobe lab is detailed [here](https://github.com/Omig12/megaprobe-lab/edit/master/content/israel.md).

The contents of the research is located [here](https://github.com/Omig12/megaprobe-lab/tree/master/content/Mutual_Files)
