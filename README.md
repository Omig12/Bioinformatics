# Bioinformatics

My undergraduate research experiences have mostly dealt with analysing the algorithm implemented in the software Mutual for Heuristic Pairwise Aligment and trying to reproduce it. This algorithm compares two samples of de-novo mRNA-Seq data, represented as De-Bruijn graphs, to detect a retrive similar transcripts shared amongst the samples from the graph itself, recovering significantly more shared transcripts. All of these research experience have been under the amazing mentorship of [Dr. Humberto Ortiz Zuazaga](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/).

Currently at the laboratory, we are working with developing and testing different algorithms for performing a differential expression analysis on the Sea cucumber (Holothuria glaberrima), that can be found in the Puertorrican coast line.

Some of our awesome lab members and collaborators are [Kevin Legarreta](https://github.com/Kevinlega), [Louis Gil](https://github.com/LouisGil), and [Claudio Vega](https://github.com/cvega69).

# Biomedical informatics  

I also worked with Causal Inference with graphical methods at the University of Pittsburgh's [Center for Causal Discovery](https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/) as part of the iBRICK summer research internship program sponsored by the IDI-BD2K, under the mentorship of [Bryan Andrews](http://www.pitt.edu/~bja43/) and [Dr. Greg Cooper](http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/listings/gregory-cooper/). The research focused on exploring the use of both experimental and non-experimental(observational) datasets in the Causal Inference research pipeline algorithms in order to acquire more information from the data and enrich the inference results.

# Quantitaive Biology Workshop at MIT

On January of 2017, I had the opportunity to visit the MIT Campus through the Neuro-ID & IDI-BD2K programs and attend their awesome [Quantitative biology workshop](https://cbmm.mit.edu/diversity/january-workshop-introduction-computational-tools-used-neuroscience-research) at the [The Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM)](https://cbmm.mit.edu) which has mostly shaped my interest in graduate studies and research topics.
