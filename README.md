My undergraduate research experience dealt with analysing the algorithm implemented in the software Mutual for Heuristic Pairwise Aligment. This algorithm compare two samples of de-novo mRNA-Seq data, represented as De-Bruijn graphs, to detect a retrive similar transcripts shared amongst the samples.
